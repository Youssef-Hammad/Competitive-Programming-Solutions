The solution is similar to a solution of knapsack problems.

You iterate over the array elements and attempt to: 1- add the element to your total sum, 2- not adding the element to your total sum

The solution is the sum between both function calls. Also memoization is done with the help of 3 states (index,current total sum, remaining elements)

Since the input can include anything in the range of a 32bit signed int, we store in the memo array sum%d.
