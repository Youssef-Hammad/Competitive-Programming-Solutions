The file "solutionTLE.cpp" applies the top down approach for the problem. Which will unfortunately get you a TLE given the problem's constraints.

The file "solutionAC.cpp" applies the bottom up approach Which solves the problem in around 0.8s. However, memory reduction is NOT applied in
my bottom-up approach as i was (maybe still am) a beginner in writing a bottom up solution for dp problems.

Bottom up approaches usually avoid building up the call stack (which happens through recursive calls) to save you memory.
