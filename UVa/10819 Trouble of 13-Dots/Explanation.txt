This solution apply a 0-1 knapsack (top-down approach) with handling for a special case.

Given the case: 
1900 3
2000 5
1950 2
101 1

The solution for this case is 3, since taking both 1950 and 101 will exceed $2000 (which will give you a $200 refund). 

We consider the index, the money remaining, and whether or not we got a refund, as our states for memoization.
